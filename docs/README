- make the whole sonnet an array - and use a random generator to parse through and stop at random word
- separate the sonnet by spaces, "" BUT when comparing the inputted word with the sonnet word ignore all punctuation
- need scanner to take in user input
- two counters - both correct and incorrect, when it reaches 3, program has to end - until then it keeps restarting
